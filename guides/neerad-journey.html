            <p class="article-preview">Neerad approached his Leukemia diagnosis with a philosophy that transformed his entire experience: treat cancer like an uninvited guest. You take care of it while it's there, give it what it needs, and then let it go when it's time.</p>
            
            <p class="article-preview">This mindset—brave, honest, resilient—helped him navigate treatment with remarkable grace. His story is a testament to the power of attitude in the healing journey, and how accepting the situation (rather than fighting it) can lead to unexpected peace.</p>

            <h3>Key Insight</h3>
            <p>Neerad was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia in 2011. When he needed a bone marrow transplant, the chemo side effects left him so exhausted and weak that he needed support to walk, and would fall if left alone. The tiredness made him angry—he'd warn his family: "It's coming, please don't react." But Neerad's approach transformed his experience: he treated cancer like an uninvited guest. You don't fight a guest—you take care of it while it's there, give it what it needs, and let it go when it's time. Instead of battling his body, he focused on healing from the impact of cancer—the exhaustion, the weakness, the emotional toll. Recovery meant rebuilding physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Today, he runs the BMT Foundation to help other patients find that same path.</p>

            <h3>What You'll Learn</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Reality of Bone Marrow Transplant</strong> — What actually happens: extreme weakness, falling constantly, needing help to walk, and the chemo fog that stops your ability to think</li>
                <li><strong>Managing the Emotional Toll</strong> — How Neerad handled anger, frustration, and the "why me" moments—and how his family created small moments of happiness even in crisis</li>
                <li><strong>Caregiver Fatigue is Real</strong> — Why caregivers accumulate stress silently, can't take breaks, and need neutral space to process—or it becomes overwhelming for everyone</li>
            </ul>
