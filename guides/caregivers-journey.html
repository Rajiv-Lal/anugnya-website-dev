            <h2>The Beginning of an 11-Year Journey</h2>
            
            <p>When Prernaa was first diagnosed with cancer, we had no idea it would become an 11-year journey. Nine reappearances. Nine times we heard those words again. Nine times we had to find the strength to fight.</p>
            
            <p>As her husband, I became her primary caregiver. It wasn't a role I chose—it was a role that chose me. And like most caregivers, I was completely unprepared for what it would demand.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                "The hardest part wasn't the medical appointments or the treatments. It was watching someone you love suffer and feeling helpless to stop it."
            </blockquote>
            
            <h2>What Nobody Tells You About Being a Caregiver</h2>
            
            <p>Everyone focuses on the patient. And they should—the patient is fighting for their life. But here's what nobody tells you: the caregiver is fighting too. Fighting exhaustion. Fighting fear. Fighting the guilt of having any needs of your own when your loved one is suffering.</p>
            
            <p>There were nights I couldn't sleep, not because of any sound or disturbance, but because my mind wouldn't stop worrying. There were days when I had to be strong in front of Prernaa, then break down alone in the car afterward.</p>
            
            <p>The emotional toll is invisible but immense:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physical exhaustion</strong> from managing medications, appointments, and daily care</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional depletion</strong> from being the constant source of strength</li>
                <li><strong>Social isolation</strong> as life revolves around treatment schedules</li>
                <li><strong>Financial stress</strong> from medical expenses and reduced work capacity</li>
                <li><strong>Anticipatory grief</strong> that nobody wants to acknowledge</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>The Guilt of Self-Care</h2>
            
            <p>One of the most difficult things was accepting that I needed care too. How could I think about myself when Prernaa was the one with cancer? How could I feel tired when she was the one going through treatment?</p>
            
            <p>But here's what I learned: <strong>You cannot pour from an empty cup.</strong></p>
            
            <p>When I finally allowed myself to seek support—whether it was talking to someone, taking a brief break, or simply acknowledging my own struggles—I became a better caregiver. I had more patience. More presence. More strength to give.</p>
            
            <div class="callout">
                <h4>A Message to Caregivers</h4>
                <p>Your needs are not less important because someone else is sick. Taking care of yourself is not selfish—it's necessary. You matter too.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>What Helped Us Through</h2>
            
            <p>Over 11 years, we learned what made the journey more bearable:</p>
            
            <p><strong>1. Building a support network.</strong> We couldn't do it alone, and we shouldn't have tried. Friends, family, healthcare workers, support groups—everyone played a role.</p>
            
            <p><strong>2. Finding moments of normalcy.</strong> Even during treatment, we tried to maintain some routines. A cup of tea together. Watching a favorite show. Small moments of regular life amid the chaos.</p>
            
            <p><strong>3. Accepting help.</strong> This was hard for both of us. We were independent people. But learning to accept help—with meals, with errands, with just being there—made everything more manageable.</p>
            
            <p><strong>4. Talking about the hard things.</strong> We talked about fear. About death. About what we wanted. These conversations were painful but necessary. They brought us closer.</p>
            
            <p><strong>5. Complementary healing.</strong> Alongside medical treatment, we explored energy healing and aromatherapy. These didn't replace medicine, but they helped with side effects, stress, and emotional wellbeing—for both of us.</p>
            
            <h2>Why I Co-Founded Anugnya</h2>
            
            <p>After Prernaa passed, I was lost. Thirty years of corporate leadership, mentoring 300+ startups—none of it prepared me for life after caregiving.</p>
            
            <p>When I met Sangeeta and learned about her vision for Anugnya Holistic Care, I knew this was where I needed to be. Not despite my experience as a caregiver, but because of it.</p>
            
            <p>I understand what caregivers go through. I understand the exhaustion, the isolation, the guilt. And I want to help others find the support that I wished I had.</p>
            
            <p>At Anugnya, we don't just serve cancer patients. We serve caregivers too. Because the caregiver needs care too.</p>
            
            <div class="article-divider"></div>
            
            <h2>For Those Walking This Path Now</h2>
            
            <p>If you're a caregiver reading this, I want you to know:</p>
            
            <p><strong>You are not alone.</strong> Millions of people are walking this path alongside you, even if you can't see them.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Your feelings are valid.</strong> It's okay to feel scared, angry, sad, or exhausted. It's okay to have bad days.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Asking for help is strength.</strong> The strongest thing you can do is recognize when you need support and reach out for it.</p>
            
            <p><strong>This journey matters.</strong> What you're doing—showing up every day for someone you love—is one of the most meaningful things a human being can do.</p>
            
            <p>Prernaa's journey ended, but mine continues. And part of my journey now is making sure other caregivers know they don't have to walk alone.</p>
