            <p class="article-preview">When someone you love is diagnosed with cancer, your life changes forever. Viiveck Verma knows this more intimately than most—he cared for his wife Prernaa through 11 years and 9 separate reappearances of cancer.</p>
            
            <p class="article-preview">His journey taught him that caregivers often forget to take care of themselves. The emotional, physical, and mental toll of caregiving can be overwhelming. But it's his personal experience as a caregiver—supporting his wife through 11 years of cancer—that drives his commitment to helping other caregivers find the support they need.</p>

            <h3>Key Insight</h3>
            <p>Viiveck cared for his wife Prernaa through 11 years and 9 reappearances of cancer—bone metastases, morphine for pain management, the constant cycle of hope and setback. Their household had a strict "no discussion" policy about the illness, believing that talking about it would cause everyone to crack. Looking back, Viiveck recognizes this stoic approach came at a cost. "I can't have a weak moment," he thought then. "That weak moment will be a very weak moment for her." Today, he sees it differently: vulnerability is not weakness, and caregivers are not superheroes. The main learning from his journey is simple but profound—asking for help is not optional, it's essential.</p>

            <h3>What You'll Learn</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A Personal Journey</strong> — How Viiveck navigated 11 years of caregiving, from the shock of diagnosis in their early 30s to managing bone pain and yearly metastatic cycles</li>
                <li><strong>The Case for Integration</strong> — Why he tried 10-11 alternative treatments and discovered the real gap wasn't in any single therapy, but in the lack of a holistic, complementary approach where practitioners work together</li>
                <li><strong>The Stoic Trap</strong> — Why the "no discussion" policy and constant bravery backfired, and his three pieces of hard-won advice: accept vulnerability as normal, seek support actively, and don't avoid difficult conversations</li>
            </ul>
