            <h2>The Potency of Essential Oil Blends</h2>
            
            <p class="interview-question"><span class="speaker-name">Interviewer:</span> What are essential oils?</p>
            
            <p class="interview-answer"><span class="speaker-name">Sangeeta:</span> They are the pure essence of nature. A couple of kilos of rose flowers will give you maybe 1 milliliter or two milliliters of essential oil, so that is the potency of essential oils. They are steam distilled, and they contain the prana (life energy) of the plant, flower, leaf, tree whatever it is. It has the vital energy that nature has put into it. That is why a drop of essential oils is so potent. Almost all essential oils are either anti-bacterial, anti-fungal or anti-microbial.</p>
            
            <p>In addition, they have special curative properties, e.g. lavender is calming, frankincense is anti-tumor, turmeric is anti-inflammatory and very good for digestion.</p>
            
            <p class="interview-question"><span class="speaker-name">Interviewer:</span> Why use essential oil blends, what is so special about them?</p>
            
            <p class="interview-answer"><span class="speaker-name">Sangeeta:</span> Everyone knows or quite a few people know about single oils right e.g lavender is very good for calm, lemon for cleansing and so on. When these properties are combined then they become even more powerful.</p>
            
            <p>Walk Easy is a blend of 6 essential oils. Collectively, they reduce inflammation and pain and help the patient to be active and mobile.</p>
            
            <h2>How Energy Aromatherapy Enhances Essential Oil Healing?</h2>
            
            <p class="interview-question"><span class="speaker-name">Interviewer:</span> How do you make essential oil blends because you understand the physical and energy properties of the essential oils?</p>
            
            <p class="interview-answer"><span class="speaker-name">Sangeeta:</span> Our secret sauce combines two elements. First, we use the healing values of plants well known in Ayurveda and ancient wisdom traditions. Second, we incorporate the energy healing properties of plants. The essential oils retain the "prana" of the plant. We combine our knowledge of the physical and energy healing properties of plants.</p>
            
            <p>It's like color therapy, where we use different colors for different healing outcomes. It is similar here as well, where we are combining the energy healing properties of plants for different outcomes. These blends then become very potent.</p>
            
            <p>Finally, they are delivered through the chakra system (energy centers). Our chakras are our gateways into the universe and our energy bodies, the chakras and the nadis (energy pathways). If you put a drop of our all-purpose oil on your throat when you are having a throat ache or feel the flu coming on it is taken in by your entire aura. The body has natural intelligence, knows what it needs to heal so it just takes the energy and physiological properties straight into wherever it needs to go. It's that simple.</p>

            <h2>Our Proprietary Blends Support Patients Through Their Cancer Journey</h2>
            
            <p class="interview-question"><span class="speaker-name">Interviewer:</span> Is there a specific set of blends that patients can use, while undergoing treatment for cancer and how does that work?</p>
            
            <p class="interview-answer"><span class="speaker-name">Sangeeta:</span> One big issue with chemo or radiation is that they make the body weak, the immune system starts becoming compromised. Sometimes the patient is so weak that they must discontinue the treatment.</p>
            
            <p>Our set of blends have been developed to prevent patients from becoming weak and immune compromised. The basic goal is to keep them strong enough so that the treatment is not interrupted.</p>

            <p><strong>Renew Foot Salt</strong> cleanses the energy system of the person by working through the nadis in the body. It removes the jangliness and the fatigue that a person feels post chemo or radiation.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Soaps:</strong> They are soft on the skin, have beautiful aroma and deliver a relaxed bath for the patient.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Walk Easy Moringa Oil:</strong> It soothes the pain that the patient feels post chemo and helps the patient to remain active and that is a boost in itself.</p>

                <h4>Important Note</h4>
                <p>However, for these to be truly beneficial, it is essential to follow the instructions of usage, make sure that they are applied on the chakras.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p class="interview-question"><span class="speaker-name">Interviewer:</span> Thank you for sharing this valuable knowledge about essential oils and energy healing. Your approach of combining traditional wisdom with understanding of chakras and energy systems offers readers a complementary way to support their healing during cancer treatment naturally.</p>
