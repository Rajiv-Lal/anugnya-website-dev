            <p class="article-preview">After radical surgery, Sangeeta couldn't even walk to her balcony. Medical treatment saved her life, but something was still missing. Her body was healing, but her spirit needed more.</p>
            
            <p class="article-preview">That's when she discovered energy healing. What started as a personal journey of recovery transformed into a decade-long study of healing practices, eventually leading to the founding of Anugnya Holistic Care—a mission to help other cancer patients experience the same transformation she did.</p>

            <h3>Key Insight</h3>
            <p>Cancer treatment left Sangeeta weak and immune compromised. After her radical surgery, she developed diabetes and high blood pressure. She couldn't paint, couldn't return to her earlier life, couldn't even walk to her balcony. Energy healing changed everything. She began receiving sessions, then learned the system herself—completing courses in therapy, crystal healing, aromatherapy, and meditation over 7 years. As her strength returned, so did her entrepreneurial spirit. Today, through Anugnya Holistic Care, she helps other cancer patients deal with the side effects of radical surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation—so they don't have to rebuild alone.</p>

            <h3>What You'll Learn</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Life After Surgery</strong> — How cancer treatment left Sangeeta with diabetes, high BP, weakness, and the inability to return to normal life—and what she did about it</li>
                <li><strong>The Power of Energy Healing</strong> — How she went from patient to practitioner, learning the system that helped her recover physically, emotionally, and spiritually</li>
                <li><strong>From Recovery to Mission</strong> — How her entrepreneurial spirit revived to create Anugnya Holistic Care, specifically designed to help patients manage the side effects of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation</li>
            </ul>
