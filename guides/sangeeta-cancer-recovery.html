            <h2>The Diagnosis That Changed Everything</h2>
            
            <p>Ten years ago, my world turned upside down. A cancer diagnosis at any age is devastating, but it's what happens after that defines your journey. For me, the journey led somewhere I never expected—from being a patient to becoming a healer, and eventually, an entrepreneur dedicated to helping others walk the same path.</p>
            
            <p>When I received my diagnosis, I was a successful creative professional. I had built Purple Arc Films, worked as a Creative Director at multiple companies, and established myself as an independent artist. Cancer didn't care about any of that.</p>
            
            <p>The radical surgery that followed was just the beginning. What came after—the recovery, the fear, the uncertainty—was in many ways harder than the surgery itself.</p>
            
            <h2>When Modern Medicine Wasn't Enough</h2>
            
            <p>Don't misunderstand me: modern medicine saved my life. The doctors, the surgery, the treatment protocols—they were essential. But after the immediate crisis passed, I found myself struggling in ways medicine couldn't address.</p>
            
            <p>I couldn't walk to my own balcony without exhaustion. The fatigue was overwhelming. But beyond the physical symptoms, there was something deeper missing. I felt disconnected—from my body, from my energy, from myself.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                "Modern medicine saved my body. Energy healing saved my spirit. I needed both."
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>That's when I discovered energy healing. A remote healer came into my life—someone who truly understood what I was going through. The transformation wasn't overnight, but it was profound.</p>
            
            <h2>Discovering Energy Healing</h2>
            
            <p>My first experience with energy healing was skeptical curiosity. I was a practical person, grounded in the visible and measurable. But I was also desperate. Nothing else was helping me recover my strength, my energy, my sense of self.</p>
            
            <p>What I discovered was something I couldn't explain but couldn't deny. After sessions, I felt different. My energy returned. My outlook shifted. My body began to heal in ways that went beyond the physical.</p>
            
            <p>I became fascinated. I had to understand what was happening. That curiosity led me to study energy healing formally—not as a hobby, but as a serious discipline.</p>
            
            <h2>From Student to Practitioner</h2>
            
            <p>Over the next decade, I immersed myself in learning:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Energy healing techniques and protocols</li>
                <li>The chakra system and energy pathways</li>
                <li>Aromatherapy and the healing properties of essential oils</li>
                <li>The connection between emotional states and physical health</li>
                <li>Psychotherapy approaches through an energy lens</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I didn't just study—I practiced. First on myself, then on others. I saw transformations that reinforced everything I had experienced personally.</p>
            
            <p>I also founded 3000 BC Therapeutics, creating AYUSH-certified essential oil blends specifically designed for healing. These weren't generic products—they were formulated based on my understanding of both traditional Ayurvedic wisdom and energy healing principles.</p>
            
            <h2>The Birth of Anugnya</h2>
            
            <p>For years, people asked me: "Why aren't you doing this for cancer patients specifically? You understand what they're going through. You have the healing skills. You have products that help."</p>
            
            <p>The answer was always: "I'm not ready yet."</p>
            
            <p>What changed was meeting Viiveck. He had lost his wife to cancer after 11 years as her caregiver. He understood the journey from a different perspective—not the patient's, but the caregiver's. Together, we realized we could build something neither of us could build alone.</p>
            
            <p>Anugnya Holistic Care was born from that partnership. The name means "grace" or "blessing" in Sanskrit. It represents what we want to offer—not a cure, but support. Not replacement for medicine, but complement to it. Grace and blessing during the hardest journey of someone's life.</p>
            
            <div class="callout">
                <h4>Our Core Belief</h4>
                <p>The best healing comes from marrying modern medicine with ancient wisdom. You don't have to choose. You can have both.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>What I Wish I Had Known</h2>
            
            <p>Looking back at my own cancer journey, there's so much I wish I had known:</p>
            
            <p><strong>That the exhaustion is real.</strong> It's not weakness. It's not in your head. Your body is fighting a war, and fatigue is part of that fight.</p>
            
            <p><strong>That emotional support matters as much as physical treatment.</strong> The fear, the anxiety, the loneliness—they affect your recovery just as much as medications.</p>
            
            <p><strong>That complementary therapies can help.</strong> Not instead of medicine, but alongside it. Energy healing, aromatherapy, meditation—they all supported my recovery in ways medicine alone couldn't.</p>
            
            <p><strong>That you don't have to do it alone.</strong> Community, support, connection—they're not luxuries. They're necessities.</p>
            
            <p><strong>That there is life after cancer.</strong> Not just survival, but thriving. Purpose. Meaning. Joy.</p>
            
            <h2>What We Offer Now</h2>
            
            <p>Everything Anugnya offers comes from this journey. Our six layers of support aren't theoretical—they're based on what actually helped me and what I've seen help hundreds of others:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Therapeutic Energy Healing</strong> addresses the energy depletion that cancer and treatment create. It's done remotely—you don't have to travel when you're exhausted.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Energy Aromatherapy</strong> uses the essential oil blends I developed specifically for cancer patients—to manage side effects, boost immunity, and support emotional wellbeing.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Energy Psychotherapy</strong> helps with the mental and emotional challenges—the fear, the anxiety, the loneliness that come with cancer.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Community Support</strong> provides connection with others who understand what you're going through.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Restorative Retreats</strong> offer immersive healing experiences for those ready for deeper work.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Self-Empowerment</strong> teaches you to become your own healer—to carry these tools with you for life.</p>
            
            <h2>A Message to Those Beginning Their Journey</h2>
            
            <p>If you're reading this as a newly diagnosed patient, or someone struggling through treatment, or a survivor wondering what comes next, I want you to know:</p>
            
            <p><strong>This is possible.</strong> Recovery, healing, even thriving—it's all possible. Not easy. Not guaranteed. But possible.</p>
            
            <p><strong>You are not alone.</strong> Millions have walked this path before you. Many are walking it right now. You don't have to figure everything out by yourself.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Your body wants to heal.</strong> Given the right support—medical, energetic, emotional—your body has remarkable capacity for recovery.</p>
            
            <p><strong>This experience can transform you.</strong> Not in spite of the suffering, but through it. The person you become on the other side of cancer can be stronger, wiser, more compassionate, more alive.</p>
            
            <p>That's my story. From patient to healer to entrepreneur. From cancer diagnosis to founding Anugnya Holistic Care. From my own healing journey to helping others with theirs.</p>
            
            <p>I'm grateful for every step of it—even the hardest ones. Because they led me here, to this work, to you.</p>
