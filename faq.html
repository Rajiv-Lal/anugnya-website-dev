                                <p>You're not imagining it—this exhaustion is real. Almost everyone going through chemotherapy experiences it.</p>
                                
                                <p>Chemotherapy targets fast-growing cells, including some healthy ones. Your body is working hard to repair this damage while also fighting cancer. This takes enormous energy. On top of that, treatment often disrupts sleep, reduces appetite, and causes anemia (low red blood cells)—all of which add to the fatigue.</p>

                                    <li>Rest when your body asks for it—this isn't laziness, it's healing</li>
                                    <li>Light movement like short walks can actually boost energy</li>
                                    <li>Stay hydrated and eat small, frequent meals even when appetite is low</li>
                                    <li>Accept help from family and friends; save your energy for what matters most</li>
                                    <li>Explore practices that restore prana: breathing exercises, gentle meditation, or energy healing</li>

                                <p>Nausea is one of the most common and distressing side effects. Your body is responding to powerful medicine.</p>
                                
                                <p>Chemotherapy triggers nausea through multiple pathways—affecting your stomach, your brain's nausea center, and your overall energy balance. When your body's vital energy (*prana*) is disrupted, digestive function often suffers.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>What helps:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Take anti-nausea medication as prescribed—don't wait for nausea to become severe</li>
                                    <li>Eat small, bland meals; avoid strong smells</li>
                                    <li>Ginger tea or ginger candies can provide relief</li>
                                    <li>Fresh air and gentle breathing exercises help settle the stomach</li>
                                    <li>Aromatherapy with peppermint or lemon can ease nausea naturally</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Yes, it's very common. Sleep disruption affects most cancer patients during treatment.</p>
                                
                                <p>Treatment medications, steroids, anxiety, and physical discomfort all interfere with sleep. At an energetic level, your body's natural rhythms have been disrupted. The flow of *prana* that governs rest and recovery needs support to restore balance.</p>

                                    <li>Talk to your doctor about sleep aids if needed</li>

                                <p>First, know that it's okay not to feel positive all the time. This is hard, and acknowledging that is healthy.</p>
                                
                                <p>Treatment can feel like an endless tunnel. Your emotional energy—like your physical energy—gets depleted. The constant demands drain your spirit. This is a normal response to an abnormal situation.</p>

                                <p>This fear is more common than you might think. You're not alone, and this fear doesn't mean you're weak.</p>
                                
                                <p>Side effects can be severe enough to make people consider stopping treatment. This is a medical crisis, but it's also an energetic one—your body's vital force is depleted, making everything harder to bear.</p>

                                <p>Here's what's happening: treatment is over, but your energy body is still recovering. Months of chemotherapy depleted your *prana*—your vital life force. Your physical body may be healing, but your energy system needs rebuilding too. This is why many survivors feel "flat" even when doctors say they're doing fine.</p>

                                <p>This is surprisingly common, and you're not imagining it. Many survivors feel more anxious after treatment than during.</p>
                                
                                <p>During treatment, you were taking action—fighting. Now, without that structure, anxiety can rush in. Fear of recurrence is real. Your nervous system has been in survival mode for months; it doesn't just switch off. And energetically, anxiety is often a sign of unprocessed fear stuck in your system.</p>
