                                    <li>Rest when your body asks for it—this isn't laziness, it's healing</li>
                                    <li>Light movement like short walks can actually boost energy</li>
                                    <li>Stay hydrated and eat small, frequent meals even when appetite is low</li>
                                    <li>Accept help from family and friends; save your energy for what matters most</li>

                                <p>Nausea is one of the most common and distressing side effects. Your body is responding to powerful medicine.</p>
                                
                                <p>Chemotherapy triggers nausea through multiple pathways—affecting your stomach, your brain's nausea center, and your overall energy balance. When your body's vital energy (*prana*) is disrupted, digestive function often suffers.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>What helps:</strong></p>

                                    <li>Take anti-nausea medication as prescribed—don't wait for nausea to become severe</li>
                                    <li>Eat small, bland meals; avoid strong smells</li>
                                    <li>Ginger tea or ginger candies can provide relief</li>
                                    <li>Fresh air and gentle breathing exercises help settle the stomach</li>
                                    <li>Aromatherapy with peppermint or lemon can ease nausea naturally</li>

                                <p>You made it through treatment—that took real strength. But the exhaustion remains, and that's frustrating.</p>
                                
                                <p>Here's what's happening: treatment is over, but your energy body is still recovering. Months of chemotherapy depleted your *prana*—your vital life force. Your physical body may be healing, but your energy system needs rebuilding too. This is why many survivors feel "flat" even when doctors say they're doing fine.</p>

                                    <li>Prioritize sleep—this is when your body and energy regenerate</li>

                                <p>This is surprisingly common, and you're not imagining it. Many survivors feel more anxious after treatment than during.</p>
                                
                                <p>During treatment, you were taking action—fighting. Now, without that structure, anxiety can rush in. Fear of recurrence is real. Your nervous system has been in survival mode for months; it doesn't just switch off. And energetically, anxiety is often a sign of unprocessed fear stuck in your system.</p>
