                                <p>You're not imagining it—this exhaustion is real and almost universal among patients.</p>
                                
                                <p>Chemotherapy is powerful medicine, but it disrupts more than just cancer cells. It affects your body's flow of vital energy—what ancient traditions call <em>prana</em>. When prana is depleted or blocked, exhaustion follows. Your body is fighting on multiple fronts: repairing cellular damage, managing treatment side effects, and trying to maintain its energy balance.</p>

                                    <li>Rest without guilt—your body is healing, not being lazy</li>
                                    <li>Light movement like short walks helps energy flow again</li>
                                    <li>Stay hydrated and eat small meals even when appetite is low</li>
                                    <li>Accept help from others; conserve your energy for healing</li>
                                    <li>Explore practices that restore prana: breathing exercises, gentle meditation, or energy healing</li>

                                <p>Nausea is one of the most common and distressing side effects of chemotherapy and radiation.</p>
                                
                                <p>Chemotherapy triggers nausea through multiple pathways—affecting your stomach, your brain's nausea center, and your overall energy balance. When your body's vital energy (<em>prana</em>) is disrupted, digestive function often suffers, adding to the weakness you already feel.</p>

                                    <li>Take anti-nausea medication as prescribed—don't wait for nausea to become severe</li>
                                    <li>Eat small, bland meals; avoid strong smells</li>
                                    <li>Fresh air and gentle breathing exercises help settle the stomach</li>
                                    <li>Aromatherapy—diffusing or applying essential oil blends with peppermint, ginger, and lemon helps calm nausea naturally</li>
                                    <li>Probiotics—fermented foods like kanji and buttermilk restore digestive balance</li>

                                <p>Your body's energy system is disrupted—anxiety, medication side effects, and physical discomfort all affect your ability to rest.

Your physical body may be healing, but your energy system needs rebuilding too. This is why many survivors feel "flat" even when doctors say they're doing fine.</p>

                                <p>During treatment, you were taking action—fighting. Now, without that structure, anxiety can rush in. Fear of recurrence is real.

                                <p>Supporting a spouse through cancer treatment is one of the hardest things you can do.</p>
                                
                                <p>Your energy is being drawn into their healing, and you may feel depleted. Your <em>prana</em> matters too—you cannot pour from an empty cup. The emotional toll of watching someone you love suffer is immense.</p>

                                    <li>Talk to someone about your own fears and grief</li>

                                <p>Your feelings are completely valid. Caregiving is emotionally demanding, and struggling doesn't mean you're failing.</p>
                                
                                <p>The energetic toll on caregivers is real—your <em>prana</em> is depleted too. You are giving constantly, managing fear, grief, and exhaustion while trying to stay strong for someone else. This is one of the hardest things a human can do.</p>

                                    <li>Your struggle doesn't diminish your love</li>
                                    <li>Taking care of yourself is not selfish—it's necessary</li>
                                    <li>Talk to someone who understands (a support group helps)</li>
