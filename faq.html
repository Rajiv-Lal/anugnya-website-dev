                                <p>Side effects can be severe enough to make people consider stopping treatment. This fear is common—and valid.</p>
                                
                                <p>Sangeeta explains: "One big issue with chemo is it makes the body weak, the immune system compromised. Sometimes patients must discontinue treatment." But there's another way to approach this.</p>
                                
                                <p>Rajiv puts it simply: "If you're able to have access to the best medical practices and tap into what exists at the level of ancient wisdom—and marry the two—then it really helps people recover very quickly."</p>

                                <p>Sangeeta is honest: "10 years later, I still wish I had more energy. Before surgery I did yoga daily, swam 2-3 times a week.

Treatment is just one part of recovery—the search for ways to become truly well continues.</p>

Sometimes you can just call out the emotion and prepare for it to vent, especially strong emotions like anger. Neerad used to warn his family: "Anger is coming to me."

                                <p>Caregivers carry a weight that often goes unseen. Everyone focuses on the patient—but you're quietly heading toward burnout.</p>
                                
                                <p>Neerad saw this clearly: "The caregiver can't say 'give me two days off, I need a break.' There's nobody around. Unless you have a healer or a neutral person, the caregiver needs a very neutral space or it can get overwhelming." The stress accumulates silently. If there's no space to release it, both patient and caregiver suffer.</p>

                                    <li>Energy healing sessions give caregivers a neutral space to release</li>
                                    <li>Weekly meditation sessions provide an outlet for accumulated stress</li>
