                                <p>You're not alone in this struggle. Nausea is one of the most challenging side effects, affecting your ability to eat, maintain strength, and continue treatment.</p>
                                <p>Our AYUSH-certified <strong>aromatherapy blends</strong> include specific formulations that many patients find helpful for managing nausea alongside their prescribed anti-nausea medications.</p>

                                <p>Yes, sleep disturbances during cancer treatment are extremely common. Anxiety, medication side effects, and physical discomfort all contribute to disrupted sleep patterns.</p>

                                <p>This feeling is valid and shared by many patients. Treatment can feel like a marathon with no clear finish line.</p>
                                <p>Our <strong>Community Support Group</strong> connects you with others who understand exactly what you're going through. Sometimes, just knowing you're not alone makes all the difference.</p>

                                <p>This fear is more common than you might think. 30-50% of cancer patients experience treatment interruptions due to side effects.</p>

                                <p>Post-treatment fatigue is real and can last weeks to months. Your body has been through an enormous battle and needs time to recover.</p>

                                <p>This is surprisingly common. During treatment, you had regular monitoring and a clear plan. Now, many survivors feel vulnerable without that structure.</p>
